    <p>
      My name is Alec Whyte. I&#39;m 26 years old, I&#39;m from Southern California, and I&#39;m an aspiring software developer. 
      My main programming language is Python, but I've used several different languages during my time in university for projects.
      
    </p>
    <p>I studied Computer Science for three of my five years at the University of California, Irvine. 
      I fell in love with coding my senior year of high school; my AP Computer Science teacher was incredibly engaging, 
      and when I started to make words I typed appear on the screen or functions I made execute, I was hooked on this 
      computer wizardry. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I studied a few different areas in my tenure at UCI; I wanted to get into CS, but it was a very impacted major. 
      I started undeclared and then moved to Math. I like numbers and calculations, so math felt right as a fallback if I couldn't get
      into what I wanted. After two years waiting for an opportunity, I was finally allowed to start taking CS classes and eventually changed my major to Computer Science.
      I graduated in 2017 with a 3.4 GPA.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I currently work as an A/V technician for Encore Global. I help setup ballrooms and breakout rooms with screens, projectors, speakers, and cabling. 
      I really like being a helpful person behind the scenes. I'm a quiet person, so being the support character in any instance is where I thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently, I started to brush up on my skills to try and get a job that's more fulfilling for me. I like what I do, but I just have no passion
      for it. I'm not obsessed with audio or video like some of my coworkers. I just work there to make ends meet. I'd much rather be learning more about
      code and actually applying what I've learned. I've truly only just begun applying things I've studied. I have a web app published on pythonanywhere 
      that took me two weeks to take from a simple API call in a python script to a functional site with a UI.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I love to game. I'm very into single player RPGs, shooters, and puzzle games. I don't really like online multiplayer games besides RuneScape, but I play that alone.
      My favorite game of all time is Fallout: New Vegas; it is truly an incredible game. The perks, the dialogue, the companions, the story are just all excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also big into TTRPGs. I love to play Dungeons & Dragons with my friends! I've been playing for over 8 years at this point. Recently, we started to play Vampire: The Masquerade, and it's been really cool so far.

    </p>
    <p>
      I play both guitar and bass for fun. I absolutely love music. Playing along with songs I like to listen to is always my go to when I pick up either instrument. I own a 7-string Sterling John Petrucci Signature electric guitar and a Fender Standard Precision Bass.
    </p>
