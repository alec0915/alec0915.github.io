This was my first proper project I did by myself outside of school. I usually struggle to find something I find interesting to work on, but this got me engaged to the point where I wanted to finish it. I worked on it off and on in my free time between work and d&d. I'm still shocked that it both works and is just live on the internet now.

I had to learn how Flask worked to get this from a python script making API calls to a proper backend that feeds data to HTML files. I really like how Flask can not only create dynamic content on pages, but it can also create dynamic URLs for pages. It's a cool idea to have template HTML files that act as a base structure that I fill with data depending on user input.

The python part was easy for me because it's my most comfortable language. I did have to de-rust initially, but I got back into it pretty quick. I had forgotten all about function decorators by the time I started this project, so I'm glad I got a bit of a refresher with Flask's primary decorator @app.route(). From my understanding, they give extra functionality to a function; in this case, it executes the function when the url is accessed. I think I'd like to play with decorators more to really get them down and understand them better.

HTML and CSS were not part of my curriculum at UCI, so I hadn't really been exposed to either at all. They don't seem too overly complex, but I don't know all of the things I could do with them. I get the basic paragraph, header, font size, background color, etc., but I know there's more to them both that I will explore as I go further.

I have it hosted on pythonanywhere because github pages doesn't play nice with Flask.
